# CodeAlpha_FileEncryption
File Encryption/Decryption Tool

This project is part of my CodeAlpha C++ Programming Internship.  
It is a simple console application that encrypts and decrypts text files using the **Caesar Cipher** algorithm.

 Features
- Encrypt a text file by shifting characters
- Decrypt an encrypted text file
- Allows user to specify the shift value
- Saves results into new files:
  - `output_encrypted.txt`
  - `output_decrypted.txt
  -  Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++
- **Concepts Used:** File I/O, Strings, Caesar Cipher, Conditionals, Loops
